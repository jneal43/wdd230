            <h1>Explore our Labs</h1>
            <p>Since 1940 we have operated our Research Labs on a contract basis, providing staff and resources to different entities who have need of our facilities. We pride ourselves on maintaining a certain level of quality in the equipment we install and the materials we purchase. We have working relationships with over 150 different chemical suppliers, not to mention industrial equipment suppliers, lighting companies, and lab grade research equipment manufacturers. </p>

                <p>Here, a researcher can be seen using our state of the art Turbo Encabulator to monitor the flux reaction of a few different base particles generated by radioactive isotopes. As the isotopes decay they release particles. The flux reactions of these particles are measured in different wavelengths with the dial seen to the right of the researcher's head.</p>

                <p>One of our researchers is capable of moving extremely quickly. Sometimes time is of the essence when performing the kinds of research that we do here at Hazard Research Labs. Having quick personnel is incredibly important for maintaining a safe and productive research environment. In this lab researchers are distilling different liquids and performing experiments with them.</p>

                <p>Here we can see one of our research assistants filling a flask with clear liquid, the starting point for all of the liquids that Hazard Research Labs uses in our experiements. The clear liquid is not water. Many people have asked us if this liquid is water and we want to be very clear on the subject. Look at where the clear liquid is coming from, why would we put water in there? We do legitimate research at Hazard Research Labs, and this clear liquid is the starting point for a lot of it.</p>
