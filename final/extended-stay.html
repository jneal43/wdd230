                <p>Many of the experiments we conduct on our long term stay subjects are sleep studies; during the day you may be free to do as you please, returning only when it is time to begin monitoring for the study. Other studies may take place during the day, and as such some freedom will be limited. Once we have selected our subjects, experiments will be explained in detail and any questions will be answered.</p>

                <p>We have long term accommodations for 30 residents, including 5 couple's suites. Once the application process is complete we will select priority candidates. Priority candidates should expect to hear from us about the dates of your stay and what you will need to prepare for before joining us on our campus. If our candidates are unable to participate in the study, more will be chosen.</p>
